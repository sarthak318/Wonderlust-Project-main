            <ph3>
                A perfect place where your travel wish meets destination.
                (And my bank meets balance if it becomes successful ðŸ˜…)

                Terms and Condition
            </h2>
            <p>
                Currently it is not big enough that i start creating terms and Conditions.
                <br>
                So No terms and conditions.
                <br>

                But I have a request please don't use to much memory for creating listings (MongoAtlas free service don't provide much space to store database)
                <br>
                Well now just Enjoy :&#41;
