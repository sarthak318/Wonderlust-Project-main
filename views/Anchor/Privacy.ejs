                Well Guys,
                <br>
                You friends don't provide me enough data which I can sell to someone and leek your privacy.
                <br>
                <u>So no need you to worry about Privacy</u>
                <br>
                And as of me 
                <br>
                My data is not that important that it will affect me if get licked.
                <br>
                I also not need to worry about Privacy.
                <br>
